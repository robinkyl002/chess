## Java Fundamentals

### Command Line Instructions
- java files are broken down to .class files 
- `javac` command compiles code into class files
- Files created are used by JVM, (Java Virtual Machine) to recreate the program
- `main` method must be present in only one file, but it must be present in the program
- `javac -d bin/ X.java Y.java Z.java`
- `java -cp bin/ X arg1 arg2 ...`
  - cp indicates class path, where the class is so it can be used
- `static` keyword says there is only one copy of the object
